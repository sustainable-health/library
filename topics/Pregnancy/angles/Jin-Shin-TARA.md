"The TARA approach is named for the buddhists deiy Tara, who is the embodiment of enlightened mercy and compassion in the female form. However, TARA is also an acronym for "tools for awakening resources and awareness." This is the TARA approach - a medicine bag of incredibly simple gifts that allows us to prevent and treat shock and trauma. The TARA approach combines energy medicine with language, communication and expression to halt the damages that shock inflicts on the nervous system, the immune system, the brain and the spirit" -- From the Book Punahele.

"Most people who discover the world of early life did not previously consider
how influential this time was or the magnitude of their commitment to being
here. By reclaiming our earliest history we have access to increased self-
respect and admiration for the stalwart, unflagging devotion to life that
sustains us during our first adventure. We dared all then and we risked all.
And we did it for love."

"This book explores the natural and man-made occurrences that can distort mind, body
and spirit away from the perfection of human birth. The overall goal here is not to dwell
on difficulties but to present designs for change and to evolve our perspective on early
experiences. Our awakening also provides a preventive function for children now and
for the children of the future!"
