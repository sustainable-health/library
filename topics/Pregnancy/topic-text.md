The field of Pre and Perinatal Psychology is quite new. As science reveals more about the neurology and physiology of our earliest development during the primal period (conception through the third year of life), and as we enhance our understanding of the nervous system, we are forced to recognize a collective error.

We have been completely wrong about the nature of prenatal life and the postnatal period.  The belief that prenatal life is without awareness has been proven false. We are coming out of the dark ages in this regard. Prenatal life is drenched in consciousness, albeit implicit
consciousness, and lays the foundation for all future health. Similarly, attunement, attachment and bonding are required throughout pregnancy
and are essential for neurological unfolding. 

These understandings point to the necessity of demarcating the major sequences in utero that are developmental thresholds for the baby. Each sequence has likely obstacles and these too can be itemized. We can then take preventive measures to protect the children of the future by removing these obstacles or lessening their damages whenever possible. Education is the first step in this direction. For this reason, the field of Pre and Perinatal Psychology is a vital addition to healthcare services and to the study of human development.
