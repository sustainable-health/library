Children elicit our greatest skill as healthcare practitioners. There are two guideposts you can rely on
for being of service to them:

1. Allow the child to lead; and
2. Understand their experience from their sensory and neurodevelopmental perspective.

The other gem children have imparted to me is this dictum: Always consider the family and environmental dynamics as the context for the child’s experiences. This includes what was happening before the child was conceived and throughout prenatal life. Each child’s birth story is
also central to understanding who they are.
