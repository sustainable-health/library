"The TARA approach is named for the buddhists deity Tara, who is the embodiment of enlightened mercy and compassion in the female form. However, TARA is also an acronym for "tools for awakening resources and awareness." This is the TARA approach - a medicine bag of incredibly simple gifts that allows us to prevent and treat shock and trauma. The TARA approach combines energy medicine with language, communication and expression to halt the damages that shock inflicts on the nervous system, the immune system, the brain and the spirit" -- From the Book Punahele.

Below are links to the available resources.

<br/>
This guide contains hands-on treatment applications. I have divided these resources into two large sections. The first focuses on sensory integration and the second on confidence or selfhood. I believe these are the foundations for wellbeing. You will also find a guide for symptomatic treatment along
with charts to support these applications in a section towards the end of this book.

Treatments for helping children calm their nervous systems for rest.
