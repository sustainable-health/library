The field of Pre and Perinatal Psychology is quite new. As science reveals
more about the neurology and physiology of our earliest development during
the primal period (conception through the third year of life), and as we
enhance our understanding of the nervous system, we are forced to
recognize a collective error. We have been completely wrong about the
nature of prenatal life and the postnatal period. The belief that prenatal life
is without awareness has been proven false. We are coming out of the dark
ages in this regard. Prenatal life is drenched in consciousness, albeit implicit
consciousness, and lays the foundation for all future health. Similarly,
attunement, attachment and bonding are required throughout pregnancy
and are essential for neurological unfolding.

These understandings point to the necessity of demarcating the major
sequences in utero that are developmental thresholds for the baby. Each
sequence has likely obstacles and these too can be itemized. We can then
take preventive measures to protect the children of the future by removing
these obstacles or lessening their damages whenever possible. Education is
the first step in this direction. For this reason, the field of Pre and Perinatal
Psychology is a vital addition to healthcare services and to the study of
human development.
