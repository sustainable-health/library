## How is Shock Different From Trauma?

 * Shock is the most severe form of trauma. It occurs when resources are non-existent, insufficient, or impossible to access.
 * Shock is more debilitating than trauma.
 * When shock that is stored in the body is activated, all unresolved shocks are simultaneously activated. This activation occurs at unconscious levels that are neither logical nor consistent. Trauma, on the other hand, is activated thematically. In other words, one can feel odd, nervous, impulsive, ill, uncomfortable or any other sensation, and not know that this is the result of shock activation. When trauma is activated, there are patterns that are understandable.

* The physiological responses to shock are long term. Chronic conditions represent an adaptation to shock. For this reason the resolution of shock is dependent on resourcing. Prenatal shock is tenacious in its impact because it represents formative, non-cognitive experience.
 * The TARA Approach is unique in providing interventions specifically adapted for the resolution of shock.
